# small_mat_mul_cuda

This repository contains a collection of CUDA scripts implementing state-of-the-art algorithms for small matrix multiplication, based on the latest research and best-ranked schemas. The schemas themselves are not original work; they are derived from the following papers and repositories:

- [Fast Matrix Multiplication Schemes from SAT Solvers (arXiv:2505.05896)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05896)
- [A Database of Fast Matrix Multiplication Schemes (arXiv:2502.04514)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04514)
